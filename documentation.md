st.title("CCP Novation & Risk Transfer Animator")
st.header("Overview")
st.markdown("""
This Streamlit application visually explains the central clearing process...
""")
```

## Novation Process Animator
Duration: 00:15

This section allows users to step through the novation process via an interactive animation. The novation process is the core mechanism by which a CCP interposes itself between two counterparties, effectively becoming the buyer to the seller and the seller to the buyer.  This transfer of obligations is crucial for reducing counterparty credit risk.

1.  **Slider Control:** A slider allows users to select a specific step in the novation process.

    ```python
    current_step_index = st.slider("Select Step", 0, len(novation_steps) - 1, 0)
    ```

2.  **Step Description:**  The title and description of the selected step are displayed.

    ```python
    st.subheader(current_step['title'])
    st.markdown(current_step['description'])
    ```

3.  **Animation Placeholder:** An `st.empty()` container is used as a placeholder for the animation.

    ```python
    animation_placeholder = st.empty()
    with animation_placeholder.container():
        create_novation_animation(current_step['diagram_state'])
    ```

4. **Data Generation:** The `generate_novation_steps()` function in `data_generator.py` provides the data for the novation process.

    ```python
    def generate_novation_steps():
        # Generate synthetic data for novation steps
        # Returns a list of dictionaries
        return [
            {'step_number': 1, 'title': 'Step 1: Trade executed on an SEF', 'description': 'Description of step 1', 'diagram_state': 'initial'},
            {'step_number': 2, 'title': 'Step 2: Trade submitted to CCP', 'description': 'Description of step 2', 'diagram_state': 'CCP_submitted'},
            {'step_number': 3, 'title': 'Step 3: Novation', 'description': 'Description of step 3', 'diagram_state': 'novated'}
        ]
    ```

5. **Visualization:** The  `create_novation_animation`  function in  `visualizations.py` is responsible for generating the actual visualization. Currently, it generates a placeholder chart; in a complete implementation, this would be replaced with an animation depicting the novation process.

    ```python
    def create_novation_animation(diagram_state):
        # Generates a visual representation of the current animation step
        # This could involve dynamically updating text and static images/diagrams or using Plotly go.Figure with frames.
        fig = go.Figure()
        fig.update_layout(title=f"Novation Animation - State: {diagram_state}")
        return fig
    ```

<aside class="positive">
This animation is critical for understanding how the CCP becomes the central node in the derivative transaction, effectively reducing the risk for individual counterparties.

## Risk Network Visualizer
Duration: 00:20

This section illustrates how a CCP reduces the number of bilateral credit relationships within a network of financial intermediaries. The key concept here is that by acting as a central counterparty, the CCP replaces numerous bilateral relationships with a single set of relationships, drastically reducing systemic risk.

1.  **Number of Intermediaries:** A number input allows the user to specify the number of financial intermediaries in the network.

    ```python
    num_intermediaries = st.number_input("Number of Financial Intermediaries (N)", min_value=2, max_value=20, value=5, step=1)
    ```

2.  **Bilateral and CCP Links Calculation:**  The number of links with and without a CCP is calculated using functions from `core_calculations.py`.

    ```python
    bilateral_links = calculate_bilateral_links(num_intermediaries)
    ccp_links = calculate_ccp_links(num_intermediaries)
    ```

    The formulas used are:

    *   Bilateral Links: $\text{Bilateral Links} = \frac{N(N-1)}{2}$
    *   CCP Links: $\text{CCP Links} = N$

3.  **Displaying Results:** The calculated number of links is displayed using `st.markdown`.

    ```python
    st.markdown(f"Without a CCP, there are $\frac{{N(N-1)}}{{2}} = {bilateral_links}$ bilateral links.")
    st.markdown(f"With a CCP, there are only $N = {ccp_links}$ links.")
    ```

4.  **Network Visualization:** The `create_risk_network_chart` function in `visualizations.py` generates a visualization comparing the risk network before and after the introduction of a CCP.

    ```python
    create_risk_network_chart(num_intermediaries)
    ```

5. **Bilateral Link Calculation:** The `calculate_bilateral_links` function computes the total number of direct connections between $N$ entities, where each entity is connected to every other entity.

    ```python
    def calculate_bilateral_links(num_intermediaries):
        # Calculates the number of bilateral links
        return num_intermediaries * (num_intermediaries - 1) // 2
    ```

6. **CCP Link Calculation:** The `calculate_ccp_links` function simply returns the number of intermediaries, as each intermediary is now linked directly to the CCP, resulting in $N$ links.

    ```python
    def calculate_ccp_links(num_intermediaries):
        # Calculates the number of CCP links
        return num_intermediaries
    ```

7. **Visualization using NetworkX and Plotly:**
    The  `create_risk_network_chart`  function in  `visualizations.py` uses NetworkX to create and manage graph structures and Plotly to render these graphs visually. The function generates two subplots: one displaying a fully connected graph representing the network *before* CCP intervention, and the other showing a star graph representing the network *after* CCP intervention.

    ```python
    import plotly.graph_objects as go
    import networkx as nx

    def create_risk_network_chart(num_intermediaries):
        # Before CCP: Fully connected graph
        G_before = nx.complete_graph(num_intermediaries)
        pos_before = nx.spring_layout(G_before, seed=42)  # Layout for better visualization

        # (Code to generate edge and node traces for G_before)

        # After CCP: Star graph
        G_after = nx.star_graph(num_intermediaries)
        pos_after = nx.spring_layout(G_after, seed=42)

        # (Code to generate edge and node traces for G_after)

        # Combine the Before CCP and After CCP graphs into subplots
        fig = go.Figure(data=[edge_trace_before, node_trace_before, edge_trace_after, node_trace_after],
                     layout=go.Layout(
                        title='Before CCP (left) vs After CCP (right)',
                        # (Layout configurations...)
                        )
                     )

        return fig
    ```
<aside class="negative">
The visual representation of the risk network is critical for understanding how the CCP consolidates risk, but it is a simplified model. Real-world risk networks are far more complex.
</aside>

## Hypothetical Risk Trends
Duration: 00:15

This section presents a hypothetical trend chart illustrating the reduction in overall counterparty risk as central clearing adoption increases.  This is a high-level visualization designed to show the potential benefits of widespread CCP usage.

1.  **Number of Periods:** A slider allows the user to adjust the number of periods shown in the chart.

    ```python
    num_periods = st.slider("Number of Periods", min_value=12, max_value=60, value=24, step=1)
    ```

2.  **Risk Data Generation:**  The `generate_hypothetical_risk_exposure` function in `data_generator.py` creates a Pandas DataFrame with simulated risk scores over time.

    ```python
    risk_df = generate_hypothetical_risk_exposure(num_periods)
    ```

    ```python
    def generate_hypothetical_risk_exposure(time_periods):
        # Creates a Pandas DataFrame simulating a reduction in systemic risk exposure over time with increased central clearing.
        dates = pd.date_range(start='2024-01-01', periods=time_periods, freq='M')
        risk_scores = np.linspace(100, 20, time_periods)
        df = pd.DataFrame({'Date': dates, 'Risk_Score': risk_scores})
        return df
    ```

3.  **Risk Trend Chart:** The `create_risk_trend_chart` function in `visualizations.py` generates a line chart using Plotly, visualizing the hypothetical risk trend.

    ```python
    fig_risk_trend = create_risk_trend_chart(risk_df)
    st.plotly_chart(fig_risk_trend, use_container_width=True)
    ```

    ```python
    def create_risk_trend_chart(df_risk_exposure):
        # Generates a line chart showing hypothetical risk exposure over time.
        fig = px.line(df_risk_exposure, x="Date", y="Risk_Score", title="Risk Trend")
        return fig
    ```

Duration: 00:05

This file contains the functions for calculating the number of bilateral links and CCP links, used in the Risk Network Visualizer section. These calculations are essential for quantifying the impact of a CCP on reducing network complexity.

*   `calculate_bilateral_links(num_intermediaries)`: Calculates the total number of bilateral links given the number of intermediaries.
*   `calculate_ccp_links(num_intermediaries)`: Returns the number of intermediaries, representing the number of links when a CCP is present.

## Data Generation (`data_generator.py`)
Duration: 00:05

This file contains functions for generating synthetic data used in the application.

*   `generate_novation_steps()`: Generates data for the novation process animation.
*   `generate_risk_network_data(num_intermediaries)`:  Currently returns an empty dictionary, but intended for generating more complex risk network data.
*   `generate_hypothetical_risk_exposure(time_periods)`: Generates a Pandas DataFrame with hypothetical risk scores over time.

## Visualizations (`visualizations.py`)
Duration: 00:10

This file contains the functions responsible for creating the visualizations in the application using Plotly.

*   `create_novation_animation(diagram_state)`: Generates the animation for the novation process. *Currently a placeholder*.

## Extending the Application
Duration: 00:30

This section provides ideas on how to extend the application's functionalities.

1.  **Enhanced Novation Animation:** Implement a more detailed and dynamic animation for the novation process. This could involve using Plotly frames or integrating with a JavaScript library for creating interactive diagrams.  Consider showing the flow of assets and obligations between the parties involved.

2.  **Advanced Risk Network Modeling:** Enhance the risk network visualization by incorporating more realistic risk factors and network structures.  This could involve using real-world data or simulating different types of financial institutions and their interdependencies. Explore different network layouts and centrality measures to identify systemically important institutions.

3.  **Interactive Risk Scenario Analysis:** Allow users to define different risk scenarios and observe their impact on the hypothetical risk trend chart. This could involve incorporating factors such as market volatility, regulatory changes, or the failure of a major financial institution.

4.  **Integration with Real-World Data:** Connect the application to real-world data sources, such as market data APIs or regulatory databases, to provide more accurate and up-to-date visualizations.

5.  **Implement More Sophisticated Risk Metrics:** The current risk trend visualization uses a very simple linear decrease in risk. Implement more sophisticated risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR) or Expected Shortfall (ES) and model their behavior under different clearing scenarios.

6. **Dynamic Novation Diagram:** Currently, the novation diagram is static. Enhance it to dynamically illustrate the flow of obligations and assets during each step. You can use libraries like `streamlit-echarts` to create interactive diagrams.
