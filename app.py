    This Streamlit application visually explains the central clearing process for derivatives,
    with a specific focus on the roles of the Swap Execution Facility (SEF) and the Central Counterparty (CCP).
    The application animates the 'novation' process, illustrating how counterparty credit risk is managed
    and transferred in centrally cleared markets. It aims to transform complex financial concepts into
    interactive and easily understandable visualizations, leveraging synthetic data to demonstrate core principles.

    **Key Concepts:**

    *   **Central Clearing:** A post-trade mechanism where a Central Counterparty (CCP) steps in between the original counterparties to a trade.
    *   **Swap Execution Facility (SEF):** A trading platform where derivatives, particularly swaps, are executed.
    *   **Novation:** The legal process by which the original bilateral contract between two parties is discharged and replaced by two new contracts with the CCP.
    *   **Counterparty Credit Risk Reduction:** A key benefit of central clearing.

    **Learning Outcomes:**

    *   Understand the novation process in central clearing.
    *   Visualize the reduction in counterparty risk through CCPs.
    *   Explore hypothetical risk trends with increased central clearing.

    **References:**

    *   [1] Section 'Central Clearing' & Exhibit 6: Central Clearing for Interest Rate Swaps, Derivatives.pdf.
