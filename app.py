# CCP Novation & Risk Transfer Animator

This application visually explains the central clearing process for derivatives, with a specific focus on the roles of the Swap Execution Facility (SEF) and the Central Counterparty (CCP). It animates the 'novation' process, illustrating how counterparty credit risk is managed and transferred in centrally cleared markets.

## Core Concepts

*   **Central Clearing:** A post-trade mechanism where a Central Counterparty (CCP) steps in between the original counterparties to a trade, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer.

*   **Swap Execution Facility (SEF):** A trading platform where derivatives, particularly swaps, are executed.

*   **Novation:** The legal process by which the original bilateral contract between two parties is discharged and replaced by two new contracts: one between the first party and the CCP, and another between the second party and the CCP.

*   **Counterparty Credit Risk Reduction:** A key benefit of central clearing. Instead of each participant facing every other participant bilaterally, they only face the CCP.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Bilateral Links Formula
The number of direct bilateral links in a network of $N$ financial intermediaries is calculated using:

$$\text{Bilateral Links} = \frac{N(N-1)}{2}$$

Where:
- $N$: The number of financial intermediaries

### CCP Links Formula
When a Central Counterparty (CCP) is introduced, each intermediary only has a direct relationship with the CCP. The number of direct links becomes:

$$\text{CCP Links} = N$$

Where:
- $N$: The number of financial intermediaries
