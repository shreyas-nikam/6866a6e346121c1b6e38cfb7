    # 5. Edge cases for 'user inputs':
    # As `generate_novation_steps()` takes no arguments, there are no 'invalid user inputs' to pass to it
    # in the traditional sense that would cause it to raise a specific handled exception (e.g., ValueError, TypeError).
    # If called incorrectly (e.g., `generate_novation_steps(123)`), Python's interpreter will raise a TypeError
    # before the function's logic is even executed, which is not an error for the function itself to handle.
    # The test focuses on verifying the correctness and robustness of the data generated when called as intended.
    # If the function were to depend on external configuration or files, those would be the "inputs" to test for edge cases.
    # Given it's for "synthetic data generation", it's assumed to be self-contained.
